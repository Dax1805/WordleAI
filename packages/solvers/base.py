"""
Solver base class + registry.

A "solver" is a strategy module that decides the next guess given the
current game state. All solvers subclass `BaseSolver` and implement
`next_guess(state) -> str`.

We keep a simple in-process registry so the CLI (and tests) can
instantiate solvers by id without hardcoding imports everywhere.

Typical flow:
    from packages.solvers import create_solver
    solver = create_solver("entropy")  # returns an instance
    solver.reset(allowed=..., answers=..., N=5, seed=123)
    guess = solver.next_guess(state)
