Config: { N=5, solvers=[letter_freq, entropy], sample=200, seed=20250819, guess_space=allowed }

Metrics to report: success rate, avg guesses (mean), worst-case guesses, % â‰¤4, mean time per case.

Tables to output: top-10 first guesses by entropy (for N=5).

Reproducibility: include wordlist SHAs and git commit.
